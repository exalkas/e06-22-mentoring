Goal
====


- Create a structure with parts etc and who says what when / storyline
- The point is to attract audience attention with a good way
- Use inrows and outrows (transitions) between topics or when changing presenters
- Use images, sketches, videos and anything visual to support your topic
- Make your voice tone excited, boring, serious and not the same all the time
- practice by recording yourself and watching it so in real time 
- SHOW WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT YOU DID AND NOT WHAT IT DOESN'T WORK AND WHAT YOU DIDN'T IMPLEMENT.

 If someone asks explicitly for some feature that doesn't work then simply answer that it doesn't work and will be implemented in future deployments. No need to lie.
 
 What to Avoid
 
 - When speaking, avoid too many 'mmm', 'aaaa', 'eeee'
 - For the features that are not working/implemented yet, you can say that will be implemented in future deployments.
 - Become too technical (e.g. showing your code) unless it's something unique or worth showing
 - NO LAST MINUTE CHANGES ON THE PRESENTED PROJECT
 
 Must do
 
 - Practise your presentation in front of a camera. record it and watch it. repeat until you feel comfortable.
	you don't have to have attention on how you look or how you sound. Your attention should be on the app or at the audience.
 
 - have as backup a local WORKING version
 
 Nice to have
 
 - Deploy on a public address so viewers can interact with it themselves
 - It's responsive
 - Presentation
 - Ideally your voice is calm and natural. If not, make sure you don't speak fast and make sure you have silence moments between sentences
 
Presentation topics:

- Introduction: Begin by introducing your project, explaining what it does, and its purpose.

- Project Overview: Provide a high-level overview of your project, highlighting the key features and functionalities.

- Technologies used: List all the technologies used in the project including the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and any additional libraries or frameworks.

- Project Architecture: Explain the architecture of your project including how the frontend and backend interact with each other.

- Design and User Experience: Discuss the design elements of your project including the user interface, user experience, and any design decisions you made.

- Features and Functionalities: Walk through each feature and functionality of your project, explaining how they work and the benefits they provide.

- Challenges and Solutions: Discuss the challenges you faced while building the project and the solutions you came up with to overcome them.

- Testing and Deployment: Explain how you tested the project and how you deployed it to a live server.

- Future Improvements: Discuss the future improvements you would like to make to the project and how they would enhance its functionality.

- Conclusion: Wrap up your presentation by summarizing your project, its key features, and how it benefits its users.

In addition to the above components, it's important to have a demo of the project so that the audience can see it in action. You can also provide code snippets or a GitHub link for those who are interested in exploring the project's code.
